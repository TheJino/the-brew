Why did we do this project?

This project aims to help "The Grind," a local business and popular hangout spot for college students, adapt to the fast-paced world where customers expect quick and modern service. By creating a more user-friendly website with features like a digital menu, customers can view items from their phones or laptops before arriving. We also plan to streamline the purchasing process by introducing a POS system for online orders, allowing customers to buy their drinks ahead of time and pick them up without waiting in line. As of current it was a work in progress but given more time, we would be able to have customers be able to order their drink online and walk in to purchase their refreshing beverage. Additionally, the introduction of a chatbot will further enhance customer experience by guiding them through menu options and offering personalized suggestions. We pushed the idea of a chatbot because most times when there is a new customer new to drinking The Grind’s specialized coffee, they may become daunted with many options, so we suggested for those customers they would be able to boil down their personalized order and increase customer satisfaction.  This project not only improves efficiency but also helps "The Grind" remain competitive in a world where speed and convenience are key to success. 

What problems did we face?
We have faced several challenges throughout the project, and we have learned that while we can’t overcome all obstacles, but you can see that as an opportunity to grow and work outside the constraints of yourself. One of the biggest challenges that we encountered was ticking of the clock, we have to overcome this by creating true coordination within our group. We had our group of four, we had 2 take care of the UI and the other 2 were coding as each part of the website was being built as each Figma screens as soon as possible.  Another challenge that was faced was the creating code for Google Gemini, the only issue that we personally were unfamiliar with the way that we needed to call the API itself was a oversight that we faced, but it was fixed later down the road and we were able to create the chatbot. The last thing that we faced that was devastating for our group was creating a database for the website. The only reason we wanted one was to simulate a POS system so the baristas would be able to see your order and be able to brew your drink while you were on the way. It would have been supported with the AI since it would ask for the order and put it on the list itself, so the customer would have a conversation with the chatbot, and it would create your drink. Overall, I would say that the issues weren’t too much for us, but better time management 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
